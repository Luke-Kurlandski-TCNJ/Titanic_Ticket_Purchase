# Titanic_Ticket_Purchase
In R, implemented a shiny web app using machine learning to allow a user to 
purchase a ticket on the titanic to determine the likelihood of their survival.

User may access the web app through repo.txt link.

Notes on production. 

I originally intended to use python machine's learning algorithms in sklearn.
The remenants of this can be found in the single python file.
Unfortunately, I encountered major struggles in deploying the python to Shiny.
I could run locally, but not on the web. 
Therefore, my final product does not reflect my goals or intentions.
Perhaps in the future I will revisit this and attempt to do more machine learning in R.
